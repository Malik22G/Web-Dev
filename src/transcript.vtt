NUMBER 10: Hungarian Parliament Building

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000

Built in 1902 in the neo-gothic style and located on the Danube River,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
it is probably the most notable and iconic building in Budapest.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Apart from impressive architecture, the building was also an engineering marvel at the time

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of its construction, for instance, a special system was designed to cool the building during

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
hot summers where a big ice cube was placed in the basement of the building every day

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and cool air was sent through a complex ventilation system.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and as a result Budapest has several incredible baths.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So much so that Budapest is actually nicknamed the city of spas.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Probably the most widely known, Széchenyi Thermal Bath is the largest medicinal bath

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in Europe and one of the largest spa complexes of its kind.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and experience the positive effects of rich thermal springs.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The name for the monument comes from a group of fishermen who lived under the wall

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
in what was called the Fishtown and defended the castle against invasions.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
back into the ruins of the former Jewish Ghetto, the first ruin pub – Szimpla quickly became

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
