            NUMBER 10: Hungarian Parliament Building<br>
            Hungarian Parliament is the largest building in Hungary<br>
            and the third largest parliament building in the world.<br>
            Built in 1902 in the neo-gothic style and located on the Danube River,<br>
            it is probably the most notable and iconic building in Budapest.<br>
            Apart from impressive architecture, the building was also an engineering marvel at the time<br>
            of its construction, for instance, a special system was designed to cool the building during<br>
            hot summers where a big ice cube was placed in the basement of the building every day<br>
            and cool air was sent through a complex ventilation system.<br>
            You can visit the parliament building with an organized tour and admire its impressive dome<br>
            housing over 900 years-old crown and learn more about the detailed architecture<br>
            of this impressive building.<br>
            Just be sure to purchase tickets online<br>
            at least a couple of days before your visit as they often run out.<br>
            Don’t forget to visit the nearby Danube Promenade<br>
            and Shoes on the Danube Bank, to honor the Jews<br>
            who were killed during World War II.<br>
            Check our travel guide for more information.<br>
            NUMBER 9: Thermal baths<br>
            Budapest is located over numerous thermal springs and bathing has been a part of everyday<br>
            life in the city since the Roman times.<br>
            During the Turkish occupation the tradition continued<br>
            and as a result Budapest has several incredible baths.<br>
            So much so that Budapest is actually nicknamed the city of spas.<br>
            Probably the most widely known, Széchenyi Thermal Bath is the largest medicinal bath<br>
            in Europe and one of the largest spa complexes of its kind.<br>
            Regardless of the season – jump in one of the outdoor pools<br>
            and experience the positive effects of rich thermal springs.<br>
            While Széchenyi Thermal Bath is for men and women all week, some other baths are open<br>
            for men or women only, depending on the day of the week.<br>
            There are many more amazing baths in Budapest.<br>
            Check out our travel guide for more suggestions.<br>
            NUMBER 8: Széchenyi Chain Bridge<br>
            Chain bridge was the first permanent bridge connecting Buda and Pest,<br>
            the two areas of Budapest located on east and west bank of the Danube river.<br>
            At the time of its construction in 1849 the bridge was an engineering wonder<br>
            and was one of the largest bridges in the world.<br>
            Cross the Chain Bridge and admire the engineering and architectural details<br>
            such a pair of lions guarding the bridge from both entrances.<br>
            Another great angle to see the Chain Bridge and explore Budapest in general is from the river.<br>
            Embark on a sightseeing cruise of Budapest or even take an inexpensive river bus version<br>
            of public transport and enjoy the view.<br>
            NUMBER 7: Fisherman's Bastion<br>
            The Fisherman’s Bastion is a monument overlooking Budapest from the Buda Castle<br>
            and it is one of the most important tourist attractions in the city.<br>
            The monument, constructed in 1902 ,<br>
            the same year as the Parliament, offers fantastic views of the city.<br>
            The name for the monument comes from a group of fishermen who lived under the wall<br>
            in what was called the Fishtown and defended the castle against invasions.<br>
            Fishermen’s Bastion features seven towers and serves as an extension of the castle.<br>
            Right behind the monument you will find impressive and beautifully restored Matthias Church<br>
            with special historic importance as it was a location of several prominent coronations of kings<br>
            and a venue of other important historic events.<br>
            There are many more impressive churches in Budapest such as St. Stephen's Basilica and others.<br>
            NUMBER 6: Buda Castle<br>
            Located just a few steps from the Fishermen’s Bastion, on the Castle Hill<br>
            there is the former Hungarian royal palace – the Buda Castle.<br>
            The first castle was built there in the 13th century.<br>
            The palace now houses museums and galleries<br>
            and the area surrounding the palace, known as the Castle Quarter, offers a wonderful<br>
            insight into what life was like in the old days with its well-preserved baroque buildings,<br>
            castle garden bazaar, the medieval fortification and other attractions.<br>
            Check out our travel guide for more information.<br>
            Located under the Castle Hill you can visit the so-called hospital in the rock.<br>
            And for an ultimate experience of the Buda Castle take a funicular connecting the square<br>
            in front of the Chain Bridge or take a short hike to the top and enjoy the view.<br>
            NUMBER 5: Ruin Pubs<br>
            Located in the former Jewish Ghetto, you will find a collection of bars and pubs with a<br>
            special character, the so-called Ruin Pubs.<br>
            Ruin pubs are just that – pubs in the ruins. First started in early 2000s to bring life<br>
            back into the ruins of the former Jewish Ghetto, the first ruin pub – Szimpla quickly became<br>
            a thing and others followed.<br>
            Today it is almost impossible to imagine Budapest without the ruin pubs. Order a beer or a cocktail<br>
            and sit in the bathtub or find another interesting place like that or just walk around and soak<br>
            in the atmosphere.<br>
            There are other interesting ruin pubs in Budapest. Check our travel guide for more suggestions.<br>
            NUMBER 4: Citadella<br>
            Located on the top of Gellért Hill lies a former fortress, a citadel – built in mid-19th<br>
            century for Austrian troops before the formation of the Austria-Hungary.<br>
            Citadella is now a popular tourist spot with amazing views of Budapest and an open-air<br>
            display of Soviet weapons.<br>
            For a truly magical experience, you can visit Citadella at night when all the main Budapest<br>
            sights are light up. Don’t forget to visit the Liberty Statue from Soviet era, erected<br>
            in 1947 which is also clearly seen from downtown Budapest.<br>
            NUMBER 3: House of Terror<br>
            You will certainly find a museum, or an art gallery close to your heart somewhere in the<br>
            city.<br>
            One of the more interesting museums includes the House of Terror, a former seat of Hungarian<br>
            Nazis and then later a seat of two Communist terror organizations. House of Terror is now<br>
            transformed into a museum dedicated to this dark era of Hungarian history.<br>
            You can experience the terrors ordinary citizens had to endure during these dark times. Just<br>
            be sure to pick the English audio guide at the beginning because the majority of the<br>
            exhibits are only presented in Hungarian except for long letter-sized descriptions in English<br>
            which might time some time to get through.<br>
            Don’t miss the Berlin Wall Memorial in front of the House of Terror Museum.<br>
            Budapest is also home to other impressive museums. Check out our travel guide for more<br>
            suggestions.<br>
            NUMBER 2: Central Market Hall<br>
            What better way to discover Hungarian culture than through food? Central market hall is<br>
            a three-story food hall where you can experience all levels of Hungarian food production – from<br>
            raw ingredients like traditional paprika, wine, to prepared traditional dishes on the<br>
            second floor, as well as traditional souvenirs and other interesting merchandise.<br>
            Central Market hall was built in 1897 by the first mayor of Budapest to create a marketplace<br>
            where only quality food could be sold with a central location to serve the city.<br>
            This impressive giant hall is located at the end of the famous shopping street Vaci Utca<br>
            and even if you’re not hungry, a stroll along the kiosks is almost like you’re traveling<br>
            throughout different regions of Hungary.<br>
            NUMBER 1: City Park<br>
            City park is the main public park in Budapest and home to impressive attractions and activities.<br>
            The park offers a great escape from busy streets. You could literally spend an entire day there.<br>
            The entrance to the park opens with the Heroes’ Square and the Millennium Monument featuring<br>
            seven leaders of Hungarian tribes along with other prominent leaders and a Memorial Stone<br>
            of Heroes.<br>
            Walk along the impressive Gatehouse Tower and admire the Jaki Chapel and Vajdahunyad<br>
            Castle built in 1896 for the celebration of 1000 years of Hungary.<br>
            The park also features an impressive ice rink, a lake, zoo and botanical garden and several<br>
            other attractions.<br>
